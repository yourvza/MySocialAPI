# MySocialAPI



## Description

API for a social network that leverages a NoSQL database to handle large volumes of unstructured data. Upon invoking the application, the server starts, and Mongoose models are synchronized with the MongoDB database. This allows for the successful creation of users, creation and deletion of reactions to thoughts, and the ability to add or remove friends from a user's friend list.
